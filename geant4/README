##Geant4

Geant4 is a MC simulation programme made by CERN. To install Geant4, use the Geant4 install script or look at the installation guide in the nikhefproject final report.

To compile the scripts one has to first run the following in the terminal:
source <Place of your Geant4 installation>/share/Geant4-10.4.1/geant4make/geant4make.sh
(or add this to your bash for convenience)

## Acknowledgements

Without the help of Panagiotis Tsopelas in giving his Geant4 simulation in the beginning or our project, our progress could have never been this far.

## Description of class structure

The folder 'include' has all the .hh files and the 'src' folder has all the .cc files
These files are connected with each other in pbm.cc
The 'ROOT' folder holds all the simulation output data and ROOT scripts to analyse this data

## Usage

Compiling everything is done easily using `gmake`, which simply follows the `GNUmakefile` script and compiles pbm.cc. You can then run the executable with or without options, like:

- `pbm` 
This runs pbm.cc and opens the Qt environment with vis.mac and let's you see the components and the tracks

- `pbm run.mac > <Output file you want to put the data in>`
This runs run.mac and puts the output of the simulation into the sepcified output file.
This output file can then be read by a ROOT script to analyse the data.

In the Qt environment you can also adjust settings like:
- /gun/energy 150 MeV
  This sets the gun energy to 150 MeV.
- /gun/particle mu-
  This sets the particle type of the gun to a muon.

To run the simulation one has to type:
/run/beamOn <number of events>
